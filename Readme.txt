Kandy.io JAVA API for space glider(collaborizm project).................

Kandy.io's api are great to work with. I am not really good at programming I just do basic stuffs of it, but when I figured out the java api of kany.io, I found it to be simple and very useful. I tried making some pages with it's java api but didn't turned out well for me as I am just beginners but I have learned much from it and surely I will be using the APIs in future for my further projects.

Possiblities of APIs in space glider project:-

Kandy's API can can be used in glider to send datas like temperature, pressure, height and location. Similarly with advance JAVA codes we can also live stream the gliders FPV to ground station over internet. Glider can also be controlled with it.

The problem that I faced with Kandy's API is that the tutorial on Kandy.io website are not very clear and they made me stuck. I mean for beginners like me it was really tough to understand. If kandy can upgrade the Tutorials with videos and extra activites than I guess it will be more understandable and clear for first timers. 
            
             Overall the Kandy's API are great and I really appreciate the work done by kandy.io, Similarly I am glad that it is carrying out Hackathon on Collaborizm.com which is surfacing the great hidden talents which can be very productive in future.
